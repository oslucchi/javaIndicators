# javaIndicators

Very early green field project to build a java library providing trading indicators using 
values on a Tick objec (open, close, high, low, tradedVolume)

The aims is to include a logger, able to normalize Ticks by predefined (configurable) windows
and to log (as the name says...) the input and consolidated values on a time-series DB
